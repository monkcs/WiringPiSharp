WiringPiSharp
=============

A nice little C# wrapper library for .Net of Gordon's [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com "WiringPi homepage") library.
It take advantage of strongly-typed enum for pin and value input to make it faster, easier and safer to access the underlying Raspberry GPIO library. It is in its initial stages but it works! ðŸ˜„

Getting Started
---------------

####1. Get Gordon's C library
   Get it from http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/.
   All neccesary installation and build steps are described over there, but for short:

   To get the source:
```bash
git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
```
   To build the C library:
```bash
cd wiringPi
./build
```
   
   That will produce a library file called **libwiringPi.so.x.x**, where **x.x** are the version number for the library.
   All refrences in *WiringPiSharp* are to __*libwiringPi.so*__, so to make the wrapper work you have to remove the version number in the filename.

####2. Download or clone this wrapper
   When you have the code, compile it using your favor of C# complier. After that it is only left for you to reference it in your project.
   
####3. Test it out!
   Here are a small example of the WiringPi and the WiringPiSharp in action that will "blink" the output on pin 14:
   
```C#
using System.Threading;
using WiringPiSharp;
using static WiringPiSharp.WiringPi;

class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Setup.WiringPiPiSetup();
        GPIO.PinMode(WPiPinout.P14, PinMode.Output);
        while (true)
        {
            GPIO.DigitalWrite(WPiPinout.P14, true);
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
            GPIO.DigitalWrite(WPiPinout.P14, false);
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
        }
    }
}
   ```


> Just make sure that __*WiringPiSharp.dll*__ and __*libwiringPi.so*__ are in the same folder as your program when you run it on the Raspberry Pi

More information
----------------
All refrences and instructions are easy to get from the [WiringPi](http://wiringpi.com "WiringPi homepage") webpage.
A really nice grapical pinout for WiringPi is [Gadgetoid's](https://github.com/Gadgetoid/Pinout2 "Pinout2 on Github") http://pinout.xyz/pinout/wiringpi.

#####*Good luck creating some awesome creations!* ðŸ˜„

All praise should really go to Gordon@drogon for his great library which exposes all the required interfaces making my life and others that much easier. Cheers Gordon!!
